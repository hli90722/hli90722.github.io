### Instructor
- Summer 2023: STATS 116 (Theory of Probability, Stanford University)

For this course I wrote some lecture notes that condense (a strict subset of) the material of the excellent [textbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VmkAAGOYCTORq1wxSQqy255qLJjTNvBI/edit) by my undergraduate thesis advisor, [Prof. Joe Blitzstein](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/joseph-k-blitzstein) along with Jessica Hwang, into an intensive 8-week course. You can view them [here](https://hli90722.github.io/pdfs/STATS_116_NOTES.pdf). All errors and omissions are my own.
