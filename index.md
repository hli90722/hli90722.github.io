Hi, I'm Harrison. Thanks for stopping by. Use the links at left to navigate this small website.

Currently, I am a PhD student in statistics at Stanford, advised by [Art B. Owen](https://artowen.su.domains/). I am grateful to be supported by the [Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sigf).

Before grad school I worked as a quantitative trader on Wall Street, and did my undergraduate studies in statistics and math at Harvard. My ongoing research interests are in experimental design, causal inference, and model intepretability. 

My dad, [Kai Li](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Li_(businessman)), has been wrongfully detained in China since 2016. The wrongful designation is based on the assessment of the US Department of State and the [United Nations
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Detention/Opinions/Session89/A_HRC_WGAD_2020_78.pdf). To help reunite our family, follow [@FreeKaiLi on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/FreeKaiLi) and support the efforts of the [Bring Our Families Home Campaign](https://www.bringourfamilieshome.org/).
