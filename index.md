Hi, I'm Harrison. Thanks for stopping by. Use the links at left to navigate this small website.

As of July 2025, I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College. Before that I was a PhD student in statistics at Stanford, advised by [Art B. Owen](https://artowen.su.domains/) and supported by the [Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sigf). My ongoing research interests include experimental design, causal inference, and related statistical problems in data fusion.

My dad, [Kai Li](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Li_(businessman)), was wrongfully detained in China from September 2016 to November 2024. The wrongful designation was based on the assessment of the US Department of State and the [United Nations
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Detention/Opinions/Session89/A_HRC_WGAD_2020_78.pdf). To help other Americans in a similar situation, please consider supporting the efforts of the [Bring Our Families Home Campaign](https://www.bringourfamilieshome.org/).
